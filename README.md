## OVERAL ANALYSIS OF PLAY STORE DATA INACCORDANCE TO BUSINESS CONTEXT
The analysis of the Play Store data revealed several key findings. Firstly, apps developed by Google have the highest number of installations, indicating their widespread usage and usefulness in daily life. The "Social" category emerged as the most installed category, followed by "Travel and Locals" and "Video Players." In terms of reviews, Facebook, WhatsApp Messenger, and Instagram stood out as the most reviewed apps, all owned by META.

Revenue analysis showcased Minecraft as the top revenue-generating app, followed by "I am rich" and "I am rich premium." The "Family" category gained significant popularity, being recognized as the most famous on the Play Store. Additionally, the "Games" category demonstrated high installations and user reviews, along with the "Tools" and "Communication" categories.

The analysis also explored app characteristics such as content rating, app size distribution, sentiment analysis, and the impact of app updates on ratings. It was found that most apps on the Play Store are suitable for everyone, with a small percentage containing adult content. The majority of apps fall into the 1-10 MB size range, and smaller-sized apps tend to generate higher revenue and receive more user reviews on average. The sentiment analysis indicated a positive correlation between subjectivity and polarity, with positive sentiment dominating the reviews.

In terms of business context, this analysis provides valuable insights for app developers, marketers, and decision-makers in the following ways:

App Development Strategy: The analysis highlights the importance of developing apps in popular categories such as "Social," "Games," and "Tools" to maximize installations and user engagement.

Monetization Opportunities: Understanding the revenue generated by different categories can help businesses design effective monetization strategies. Categories like "Family," "Lifestyle," and "Games" present significant revenue potential.

User Satisfaction and Retention: Regular app updates have a positive impact on user ratings, suggesting that businesses should prioritize regular updates to enhance user satisfaction and retention.

Targeted Marketing and User Engagement: The analysis provides insights into the most reviewed apps and popular categories, allowing businesses to target their marketing efforts and engage users effectively.

Competitive Analysis: By understanding the market dominance of Google-developed apps and the revenue potential of different categories, businesses can evaluate their position in the market and identify opportunities for growth and differentiation.

Overall, this analysis equips businesses with valuable information to make data-driven decisions, optimize their app development and marketing strategies, and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the Play Store ecosystem.
